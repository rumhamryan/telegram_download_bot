# Plex Torrent Automation Bot

This is a sophisticated Telegram bot that automates the process of downloading torrents and organizing them for a Plex media server. It intelligently parses torrent names, enriches metadata from Wikipedia, renames files, and triggers Plex library scans automatically.

## Core Features

*   **User Authorization**: Restricts bot access to a whitelist of Telegram User IDs.
*   **Smart Content Parsing**: Automatically detects whether a download is a movie or a TV show.
*   **TV Show Metadata**: For TV shows, it scrapes Wikipedia to find the exact episode title.
*   **Plex-Friendly Naming**: Renames files to a clean, Plex-compatible format (e.g., `Show Name/Season 01/s01e01 - Episode Title.mkv`).
*   **Automated File Organization**: Moves completed movie and TV show downloads to their respective library folders.
*   **Plex Integration**: Automatically triggers a library-specific scan on the Plex Media Server after a download completes.
*   **Download Persistence**: Resumes any active downloads if the bot is restarted.
*   **Clean UI**: Deletes user commands and edits status messages in place to keep the chat tidy.

## System Configuration & Installation

This project is designed to run on both Windows and Linux (Ubuntu). Follow these steps carefully.

### Step 1: System Prerequisites

Before setting up the Python environment, ensure the necessary system-level dependencies are installed.

#### Python
*   **Python 3.11.8 or later** is required. It is assumed that you have Python installed and available in your system's PATH. You can verify this by running `python --version` or `python3 --version`.

#### C++ Dependencies (Crucial for `libtorrent`)
The `libtorrent` package is a Python wrapper around a powerful C++ library. For it to work, the underlying C++ components must be available on your system.

*   **On Windows**:
    *   The `libtorrent` Python package often relies on the **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable**.
    *   Many systems already have this installed. If you encounter errors during the `pip install` step related to missing DLLs (like `VCRUNTIME140.dll`), you will need to install it.
    *   You can download the latest version directly from Microsoft's website: [Latest supported Visual C++ Redistributable downloads](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170). Be sure to install the **x64** version.

*   **On Ubuntu / Debian**:
    *   The equivalent of the C++ dependency is provided by the `libtorrent-rasterbar` package. You must install this from the system's package manager **before** installing the Python packages.
    *   This command installs both the required runtime library and the development files needed by `pip`.
    *   Run the following in your terminal:
        ```bash
        # Update your package list
        sudo apt-get update

        # Install the libtorrent-rasterbar library and its development headers
        sudo apt-get install -y libtorrent-rasterbar-dev
        ```

### Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

Using a virtual environment is highly recommended to isolate project dependencies.

1.  **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal or command prompt.
2.  **Create the virtual environment**: `python3 -m venv venv`
3.  **Activate the virtual environment**:
    *   **Windows**: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    *   **Ubuntu / Debian**: `source venv/bin/activate`

### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated (and after completing Step 1), you can install all required Python packages with a single command.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Configure the Bot

Configuration is handled in the `config.ini` file.

1.  **Create `config.ini`**: If it doesn't exist, create it.
2.  **Edit the file** with your details:

    ```ini
    [telegram]
    # Get your bot token from @BotFather on Telegram
    token = PLACE_TOKEN_HERE
    # Get your numeric User ID from @userinfobot on Telegram
    allowed_user_ids = 123456789

    [plex]
    # (Optional) Your Plex server URL and API token
    plex_url = http://192.168.1.100:32400
    plex_token = YOUR_PLEX_TOKEN_HERE

    [host]
    # Define absolute paths for your media. Use forward slashes for both OSes.
    default_save_path = C:/Telegram Downloads/Unsorted
    movies_save_path = D:/Media/Movies
    tv_shows_save_path = D:/Media/TV Shows
    ```

### Step 5: Run the Bot

With your virtual environment active and configuration complete, start the bot:

```bash
python telegram_bot.py
```

To stop the bot, press `Ctrl+C`. Remember to reactivate the virtual environment (`source venv/bin/activate` or `.\venv\Scripts\activate`) every time you want to run the bot in a new terminal session.

## Bot Commands

*   `/start` - Displays a welcome message.
*   `/help` - Shows a brief help message.
*   `/cancel` - Stops your currently active download.
*   `/plexstatus` - Checks the connection to your Plex server.
